 * The recognition rule is pure and OpenCV-free so it can be exercised on real capture frames in
 * plain JVM tests through [AttackButtonPixels] (the [AttackButtonDetector] bridge is the only
 * part that touches a `Mat`). This keeps the tested decision byte-for-byte identical to the
 * decision the product runs.
 *
 * The control is identified by structure, never by a remembered screen position:
 *  - it is a compact, roughly circular ring of strongly saturated pure red,
 *  - the ring encloses a non-red core (the weapon icon and/or the pale touch indicator), so the
 *    exact center pixel is intentionally *not* required to be red,
 *  - it is neither an elongated red world bar (enemy health bars) nor a solid red rectangle
 *    (plain red boxes / ambiguous panels) nor a solid red blob with a red center.
 *
 * Any frame yielding zero or more than one such control is treated as uncertainty and produces
 * `null`; there is deliberately no fixed-coordinate fallback. The bounds are expressed as
 * fractions of the capture height, so a rescaled or repositioned control is still recognized.
