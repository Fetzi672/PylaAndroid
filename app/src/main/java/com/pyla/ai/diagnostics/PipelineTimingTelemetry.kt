/**
 * Process-session, RAM-only pipeline timing observations for diagnostics.
 *
 * Observation only: no images, tensors, configuration, paths, device IDs, file
 * or network I/O, no persistent log, no callbacks and no threads. Every public
 * function is noexcept: a failing clock, sink or allocation can never change
 * caller control flow, and a missing clock simply yields {@code -1} /
 * no observation.
 *
 * [nowMs] is the only sanctioned timing start for callers. It is not an
 * authoritative clock: on failure it returns -1 and callers must keep their
 * existing control decisions.
 *
 * Summaries are emitted at most once per 5 s window, one bounded line per stage,
 * from the thread that crosses the window boundary. Quantiles cover the last
 * 128 retained samples per stage and say so (`sample=last128`).
